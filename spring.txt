Question :1:- What is Spring Frame work ??
Answer :- 
.Spring Frame work is a free and open source java application frame work and was created by rot johnson in 2003.

.It was created for enhance the productivity of the developer.

**It was created by using a simple design pattern INVERSION OF CONTROL(IOP) OR DEPENDENCY INJECTION.

Question :1:- What is IOP Container or Dependency injection engine ??

Answer :- .This is the first module  of Core spring frame work.

Let say in class A we have created the object of Class B then Class A is completly dependent on class B.If we make any changes in Class B any where then this change in class B may force you to change in Class A as well. So in big projects many classes will be like this and if we remove this dependency it can solve many problems.

****SO here comes IOC container importance.


Question :3:- What is Aspect oriented programming ??

Answer :- .This is the seconed module  of Core spring frame work is another concept as we have oops.

**This says is that if there is a certain thing you are using in a project which not a part of main business logic for example LOG IN, TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT etc.then why should add such things as part of your main business logic.

example:-
public class Calcultaer{
private int addition;

public boolean addittion{
**logger.info("Entered into Calculator.addition(a,b)method");//it's not a part of main business logic.
try{
**addition = a+b;//THIS IS THE PART OF MAIN BUSINESS LOGIC.
}catch(Exception e){
**logger.info("Error occured in Calculator.addition(a,b)method");//it's not a part of main business logic.
}
**logger.info("Exiting from Calculator.addition(a,b)method");//it's not a part of main business logic.

return addition;//THIS IS THE PART OF MAIN BUSINESS LOGIC.
}
}

**HERE we r mixing both functional and non-functional logic which may lead a greate difficulty to manage your big java project.

***So this spring modules provide a simple mechanism of how you can impelement all such no-functional or non-business things as a seprate entity just like a seprate class for seprate responsibility in your project and it's not only logs many things which you mix haviley in your business functions.

.So you will be able to see logs in the log file but you do not to weite log statements within your functions
